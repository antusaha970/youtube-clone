# Welcome to my Youtube Clone project, built entirely from scratch using React JS library

As a frontend developer, I wanted to showcase my skills in designing and developing complex user interfaces. For this project, I have used a variety of popular tools and technologies including React, React-Router, Axios, Material UI, and React-Player.

One of the key features of this project is the use of a 3rd party API to retrieve and display data from Youtube. I have implemented this API in a way that is both efficient and effective, allowing users to easily browse and view videos on the platform.

In addition to the core features, I have also implemented a number of advanced features such as infinite scrolling. This functionality allows users to browse through large collections of videos without the need for traditional pagination.

Overall, this project showcases my ability to work with a variety of different technologies and tools to deliver elegant and functional user interfaces. Whether you are a developer looking for inspiration or a user looking for a new way to browse and view videos, this project is sure to impress.
